# Welcome to the CDAC Summer Lab 
### What is the Data and Computing Summer Lab Program? 

Welcome to the Data & Computing Summer Lab 2020! People make this program what it is, and our high hopes for this year come from our excitement in welcoming all 38 of you to the program. Each one of you brings a unique background, perspective, and skill set to your research project. CDAC is an interdisciplinary research center, and the impressive range of your projects manifests that multifaceted approach to data science by encompassing over twenty different domains and approaches. We can’t wait to see what you accomplish during this program, and hope to support you along the way.

### Program Mission
The mission of the program is to foster an inclusive research environment where students from all backgrounds gain hands-on research experience and build critical computational and data science skills. It’s our goal to run a program that balances the rigors of research with a collaborative, cohort experience to train the next generation of interdisciplinary computational and data scientists. 

### Student Experience
This program offers you the chance to learn, possibly for the first time, outside of a classroom environment. This can bring its own challenges, but we hope that you make the most of this research experience. This program also uniquely offers you chances to collaborate and build friendships with fellow young minds intrigued by computational puzzles. We hope you use this summer to: 
* Engage with and contribute to your cohort and cluster
* Conduct interdisciplinary data science research 
* Collaborate with and learn from your cohort peers
* Learn about cutting-edge research, beyond your own research project topic, in the weekly speaker series 
* Develop new computational, data science, and research skills
* Practice discussing and presenting research findings, culminating in final video presentation

### Research Assistant (RA) Expectations

**The Cohort:** At the core of the Summer Lab program is the cohort: that’s you! And your fellow RAs. Cohort building occurs through various aspects of the program, such as: engaging in discussions with your cluster and peer tripod, attending talks, participating in discussions in Slack, joining program social activities, and posting and answering questions in the Slack #helpdesk channel. By participating in the program to your fullest ability and contributing to the cohort experience, each RA is expected to abide by a collegial, mutually-respectful code of conduct (as upheld in the UChicago Student Manual).

**Peer Mentoring:** We’re all here to learn, and sometimes the best way to do that is by asking and answering questions of your peers. There are many resources for asking questions -- lab coordinator office hours + Slack messages; your cluster Slack channel. The space explicitly open for peer-answered questions is the #helpdesk Slack channel, where both RAs and Summer Lab team members are encouraged to ask and answer questions.

**Attendance:** All RAs are expected to complete the full ten weeks of the program. If for any reason you need to request time off, please discuss the situation with your mentor(s), Kyle, and Katie. Mentors have final say over adjusted schedules, and any scheduling agreements should be addressed in the Learning Agreement document. 
There are two weekly, required meetings for all RAs: a standup meeting on Mondays at 10:00-10:30am CT, and a speaker series talk on Wednesdays at 11:00am-12:00pm CT. All other meetings are optional, but encouraged, unless otherwise noted.
